# Machine Learning
Introduction to the hot topics

## About
This repository is a sort of storage for basic ML programs 
that I do. Each project is in a separate folder and mostly 
these will be Jupyter notebooks because of the ease.

So if someone wants to use this, there is a dataset download link in the readme in most projects. Otherwise there will be instructions. There is a trained model pickle included wherever possible.

### Required
- Python 3.6
