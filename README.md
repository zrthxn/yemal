Introduction to the hot topics

## About
This repository is a sort of storage for basic ML programs 
that I do. Each project is in a separate folder and mostly 
these will be Jupyter notebooks because of the ease.

So to those wishing to use this, there is a dataset download link in the readme 
in most projects. Otherwise there will be instructions.
