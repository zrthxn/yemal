### Notes

# Confidence vs. Accuracy
There is often some confusion between what is meant by accuracy and confidence. This is a small clarification 

## Confidence
Confidence is a measure of how "sure" the program is of the decision it has made. This is analogous to being "70% sure I will pass". It means that the decision has been taken with a certain confidence. 

A high confidence means that the program is making nearly certain decisions or predictions. A high confidence **does not mean** that the program is performing well. The actual performance of the program is measured by the accuracy.

In general we want all our models to produce a high confidence result.

## Accuracy
Accuracy is a measure of how close the produced result is to the actual desired result.
